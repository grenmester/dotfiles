# Dotfiles
These are the dotfiles that I personally use for macOS. There is a `.gitconfig` which contains my configuration for `git`. There is also a `.vimrc` for my `vim` preferences. In addition, there is also a `.bash_profile` for when I use the `bash` shell. This file is not updated since I have switched over to `zsh`. My `.zshrc` contains the configuration for when I use the `zsh` shell.
